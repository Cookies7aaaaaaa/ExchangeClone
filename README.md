A [Minetest](https://www.minetest.net/) mod to exchange nodes into other nodes. This is mod is inspired by the "Equivalent Exchange" mod for MineCraft, and forked and modified from [Element Exchange](https://github.com/enchant97/minetest_element_exchange). In other words, most of the code is not mine.
