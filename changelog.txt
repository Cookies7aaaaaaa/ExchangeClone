2.1
    The Energy Collector setting is now energy/second instead of second/energy to fit much higher costs than Element Exchange (default is 5 energy/s).
    Fixed Exchange Orb energy value (forgot to change it after changing the recipe)
    Changed constructor, deconstructor, and collector recipes and energy values to make them cheaper
    The Constructor, Deconstructor, and Energy Collector are now not unbreakable in MineClone (I really should test in survival).
    The Energy Collector now drops its contents when broken in MineClone.
    Copper blocks are now worth 4 times as much as copper ingots instead of 9 (MineClone).
    Fixed terracotta values (MineClone)
    Set gravel value to 1 to match sand/stone/dirt/etc (MineClone).
    Tuff, blackstone, and basalt are now transmutable (MineClone).
    A couple of minor transmutation changes (MineClone).
