3.0
    New features:
        Added Alchemical Coal, Mobius Fuel, Aeternalis Fuel, Dark Matter, and Red Matter

    Changes:
        The Energy Collector setting is now energy/second instead of second/energy to fit much higher costs than Element Exchange (default is 5 energy/s).
        Set gravel value to 1 to match sand/stone/dirt/etc (MineClone).

        A couple of minor transmutation changes (MineClone).

        Gold cannot be crafted into diamonds using the PS; it can now be crafted into emeralds and emeralds into diamonds (MineClone).
        The PS's enchanting table now is limited to 8-bookshelf enchantments to make it more balanced.

        Copper blocks are now worth 4 times as much as copper ingots instead of 9 (MineClone).
        Fixed terracotta values (MineClone)
        The Energy Collector now drops its contents when broken in MineClone.
        Fixed Exchange Orb energy value (forgot to change it after changing the recipe)
            Changed constructor, deconstructor, and collector recipes and energy values to make them cheaper.
        The Constructor, Deconstructor, and Energy Collector are now not unbreakable in MineClone (I really should test in survival).
