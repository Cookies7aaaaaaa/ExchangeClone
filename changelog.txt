    Bugfixes:
        Ghost Blocks (from Why) are now worth 0 instead of 1 (to prevent infinite energy)

3.0 (the most interesting release so far)
    New features:
        Added Alchemical Coal, Mobius Fuel, Aeternalis Fuel, Dark Matter (blocks and orbs), and Red Matter (blocks and orbs)
        Added PESA (Personal Energy Storage Accessor)
            A single inventory slot in which an orb can be placed. Energy from the orb is used for special abilities.
        Added Dark and Red Matter tools
            Faster than any other tools (in unmodded MTG/MCL), each has an ability
            Special abilities that break nodes (as well as shearing) drop items directly on the player.
            Swords:
                Can damage all mobs within a radius (Red Matter sword can toggle between hostile/all mobs), costing 384 energy.
            Pickaxes:
                Has 3x1 modes (long, tall, and wide, all slightly slower)
                Can mine a full vein of ores, dropping items and experience on the player
            Axes:
                Can break all wood and leaves within a radius, costing 8 energy per node broken.
            Shovels:
                Can break all shovely nodes within a radius, costing 8 energy per node broken
                Can create paths in a radius, costing 8 energy per node
            Hoes:
                Breaks dirt incredibly quickly (and unfortunately all other shovely nodes because I can't figure out how to avoid it)
                Has a 3x3 mode for digging dirt (slightly slower)
                Can till all dirt within a radius, costs 2 energy per node
            Hammers:
                Breaks pickaxey nodes in a 3x3 area
                Can break all pickaxey nodes within a radius, costing 8 energy per node broken
            Shears:
                More wool/mushrooms dropped when shearing, chance of cloning sheep/mooshrooms
                Can shear all shearable plants/cobwebs within a radius, costing 8 energy per node broken.

    Changes:
        Added a mod whitelist in energy.lua, any item from a mod NOT in the whitelist (exchangeclone.whitelisted_mods) will have an energy value of 0
        Orbs now show their energy on right click instead of left click
        Changed Philosopher's Stone controls to make everything more consistant
        The Energy Collector setting is now energy/second instead of second/energy to fit much higher costs than Element Exchange (default is 5 energy/s).
        Set gravel value to 1 to match sand/stone/dirt/etc (MineClone).
        Tuff, blackstone, and basalt are now transmutable (MineClone).
        A couple of minor transmutation changes (MineClone).
        Changed emerald value to 4096 (MineClone).
        Gold cannot be crafted into diamonds using the PS; it can now be crafted into emeralds and emeralds into diamonds (MineClone).
        The PS's enchanting table now is limited to 8-bookshelf enchantments to make it more balanced (MineClone).
        Fixed terracotta values (MineClone)
        Enchanted tools/armor are now worth the same amount as unenchanted tools/armor instead of twice as much (MineClone).
        Enchanted tools/armor cannot be created by the Constructor (MineClone).
        It is now impossible to get stacks of invalid sizes with the Constructor (>16 ender pearls or >1 pickaxe, for example)
    Bugfixes:
        Fixed freezing when attempting to deconstruct 0-energy items
        The Constructor, Deconstructor, and Energy Collector are now not unbreakable in MineClone (I really should test in survival).
        Copper blocks are now worth 4 times as much as copper ingots instead of 9 (MineClone).
        The Energy Collector now drops its contents when broken (MineClone)
        Fixed Exchange Orb energy value (forgot to change it after changing the recipe)
            Changed Constructor, Deconstructor, and Collector recipes and energy values to make them cheaper.
3.1
    Changes:
        Added new energy values from Why (and Why's new Minetest Game energy values)
    Bugfixes:
        Fixed crash based on PESA inventory movement
        Added mcl_blackstone to the mod whitelist
3.2
    Changes:
        Set MineClone mod namespace to exchangeclone
4.0
    New features:
        The "Features that I plan on adding eventually" list below
        Cooldowns for tool abilities to limit lag
        Red Katar (combination of sword, axe, hoe, and shears)
        Red Morningstar (combination of hammer, pickaxe, and shovel)
        Dark Matter Armor (full set gives immunity to lava/fire and drowning)
        Red Matter Armor (full set gives lava/fire/drowning immunity PLUS 2000 health, although you may want HUD Bars to see it)
        Added energy values for MineClone's new items.
    Changes:
        Changed the amount of damage done by Dark/Red Matter Sword special abilities (used to be max_damage/distance, now is max_damage-distance)
        A whole bunch of things that won't be noticible when playing, mostly code reorganization. It's POSSIBLE that tools that mine multiple nodes (hammer, pickaxe, hoe, katar, and morningstar) will be less laggy
        Texture/sound license changed to CC-BY-SA-3.0 (because GPLv3+ isn't really meant as a media license).
    Bugfixes:
        Fixed an issue where MineClone dispensers could ONLY be used with Dark/Red Matter Shears.

Plans for 4.1
    New features:
        New items from the next version of Why (I'm planning on doing that next)

Plans for 5.0
    New features:
        Exchangeclone guidebook (maybe depend on doc mod?)
        The ability to upgrade dark/red matter tools to give them fortune, looting, fire aspect, and silk touch
        The ability to upgrade dark/red matter armor to give it thorns and frost walker
        Ability to smelt with the Philosopher's Stone and coal/charcoal
        Mind, Life, Body, and Soul Stones


Features that I plan on adding eventually:
    Something that places nodes in a square (with varying range), possibly with a low energy cost
    As soon as Minetest 5.8 comes out, better textures for armor...
    Dark/Red Matter Furnaces
    Energy Condenser
    Upgraded Energy Collectors
    Transmutation Tablet (including portable version)
    Divining Rods
    Rings (I'll probably add a new PESA-like item for holding rings)
        Archangel's Smite (though arrows will not track targets)
        Ring of Ignition
        Swiftwolf's Rending Gale (though without the force field)
        Zero Ring
        Ring of Arcana (minus the Harvest band)
    Gem Armor
