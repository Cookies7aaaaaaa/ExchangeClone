            Special abilities that break blocks (as well as shearing) drop items directly on the player.
            Swords:

                Has 3x1 modes (long, tall, and wide, all slightly slower)

            Hoes:
                Breaks dirt incredibly quickly (and unfortunately all other shovely blocks because I can't figure out how to avoid it)
                Has a 3x3 mode for digging dirt (slightly slower)
                Can till all dirt within a radius, costs 2 energy per block

        Orbs now show their energy on right click instead of left click
        Changed Philosopher's Stone controls to make everything more consistant
        The Energy Collector setting is now energy/second instead of second/energy to fit much higher costs than Element Exchange (default is 5 energy/s).
        Set gravel value to 1 to match sand/stone/dirt/etc (MineClone).
        Tuff, blackstone, and basalt are now transmutable (MineClone).
        A couple of minor transmutation changes (MineClone).

        Gold cannot be crafted into diamonds using the PS; it can now be crafted into emeralds and emeralds into diamonds (MineClone).
        The PS's enchanting table now is limited to 8-bookshelf enchantments to make it more balanced (MineClone).
        Fixed terracotta values (MineClone)
        Enchanted tools/armor are now worth the same amount as unenchanted tools/armor instead of twice as much (MineClone).
        Enchanted tools/armor cannot be created by the Constructor (MineClone).
        It is now impossible to get stacks of invalid sizes with the Constructor (>16 ender pearls or >1 pickaxe, for example)
    Bugfixes:
        Fixed freezing when attempting to deconstruct 0-energy items
        The Constructor, Deconstructor, and Energy Collector are now not unbreakable in MineClone (I really should test in survival).

        The Energy Collector now drops its contents when broken (MineClone)
        Fixed Exchange Orb energy value (forgot to change it after changing the recipe)
