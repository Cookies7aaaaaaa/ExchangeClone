# Contributing Guidelines
If you want to contribute, please do so, either through issues or pull requests.

Feel free to report any problems or suggestions (including things as small as typos). If you know how to fix it, a PR would be even more useful.

Please follow the [Code of Conduct](code_of_conduct.md) when contributing.
